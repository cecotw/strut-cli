# Strut CLI

> Strut automates the setup of projects in AWS by generating an OU, their accounts, and a project repository that contains the project infrastructure to deploy to the accounts.

This empowers developers to focus on code while still retaining the ability to define their infrastructure for each application in the project along with maintaining the capability to define project wide resources.
