# Strut CLI

> Strut is an IaC (Infrastructure as Code) devops utility that orchestrates applications and cloud providers.

Want to run containers across multiple clouds? We got you. Need a way to orchestrate 10 microservice repos and a SPA front end on AWS? No problem. AWS prices got you in a bind? Simply add a new provider. We will get your whole flow setup using the tools native to the provider. Thinking about moving to the cloud? We can get you off that metal and floating faster than you ever thought possible.

Developers are empowered to define their application(s) stack in a way that makes sense for their team's product. The provider setup is designed to provide a cloud agnostic provisioning and deployment system that is consistent for supported providers. By enabling dynamic cloud providers, unsupported and future providers work great.

Our goal is for developers to focus on useful business code while still retaining the ability to define their infrastructure, while having a consistent experience.
